# Metaheuristic Optimization in C++

This repository contains C++ implementations of various **metaheuristic algorithms** designed to solve complex optimization problems. The focus is on **single-solution based techniques**, including:

- **Local Search**
- **Tabu Search**
- **Simulated Annealing**

These algorithms are widely used for finding near-optimal solutions in large and complex search spaces where traditional methods fall short. The code is modular, easy to understand, and suitable for experimentation and comparison across different parameters and problem instances.

## Features

- Clean and well-commented C++ implementations  
- Support for custom cost/objective functions  
- Parameter tuning and performance evaluation tools  
- Comparison of algorithm behavior under different settings  
- Mutation operator included (for potential Genetic Algorithm extension)

## Getting Started

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/metaheuristic-cpp.git
   cd metaheuristic-cpp
## Compile the code
